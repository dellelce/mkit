# mkit

Download and Build a complete Apache/PHP/Python(mod_wsgi) stack.

## TODO:
  * SANITY CHECKS: Test if basic pre-requisites: gcc/g++ are there (we are not going to installed them!)
  * NO: Test if a component is needed (missing on the system)
  * YES: Add ability to re-use installed system component (use installed pcre instead of downloading it)
  * Give more options (i.e. force download)
  * Test if after "make install" component is actually there 

## REQUIREMENTS:
  * gcc
  * g++ (pcre)
  * perl, Data/Dumper.pm
